# Search experience consuming the Rick and Morty API with Vue 

Second challenge as an academy fellow in Empathy.co, there are two branches:
- main: contains the challenge implemented with Vue.
- vuex: contains the code from main migrated to Vuex.

# VueX project challenge

## Prerequisites:

* Use your `vue` project created in the previous session.
* Create a new branch in your project to develop this challenge instead of creating a new project. Call it: `vuex-chanllenge`

## Steps to complete:

1. Create a basic store and move some data from your components to the store.
2. Use getters and the state to retrieve the info from the store.
3. Create mutations that modifies the state.
4. Create an action to call the api.
5. Divide the store en two modules, these modules should interact between them. Use `namespaced:true`.
